    <pre class="main"> My name is Zac Rosati. I'm 36 years old I have a wife and 4 kids.
I Work For Trane Technologies, doing HVAC Controls. I have been interested in web design
since highschool. But the career path I have chosen hasn't been one in that field.
I have taken networking classes,electrical,some low voltage wiring, and now Intro to web design.
I plan on getting a computer infotmation science degree from OTC, but would like to continue my education
 after that.
I do not know exactly when I will recieve this degree,
mostly because I would like to focus more on my job at the moment.
But I will persevere.
When I'm not working I'm usually doing something adventurous with my family.
I have many hobbies, but making music, wood working and hiking are my top 3.
